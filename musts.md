# must do/read/watch list

I love to read, watch, listen and talk about software engineering, we all do right? :D

These are some books, articles, videos and tutorials that changed the way I think about development...

Have suggestions? [@gillchristian](https://twitter.com/gillchristian) :D

## general

- [The Twelve Factor App](https://12factor.net/): The top item in the whole list, really a *MUST* for anybody building web.

## front-end

- [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html): Awesome tutorial on thinking UIs as composable components. Although it is a React tutorial, the principles apply to any _component based_ framework.

- [Getting started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux): Dan Abramov's walk through Redux library.

- [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux): Follow up to the previous course, Dan introduces many good practices for building React/Redux apps.
