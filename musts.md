# must do/read/watch list

I love to read, watch, listen and talk about software engineering, we all do right? :D

These are some books, articles, videos and tutorials that changed the way I think about development...

Have suggestions? [@gillchristian](https://twitter.com/gillchristian) :D

## general

- [The Twelve Factor App](https://12factor.net/) The top item in the whole list, really a *MUST* for anybody building for the web.
- [Git from the inside out](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/two/git-from-the-inside-out) How git internals work.

## paradigms and languages

- Professor Frisby Functional JavaScript:
  - [Egghead series](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript)
  - [Book](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide)

## front-end

- [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) Awesome tutorial on thinking UIs as composable components. Although it is a React tutorial, the principles apply to any _component based_ framework.

- [Getting started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) Dan Abramov's walk through Redux library.

- [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux) Follow up to the previous course, Dan introduces many good practices for building React/Redux apps.
